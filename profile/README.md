# Welcome to our github
This is an unofficial Dell github focused on data protection automation. 
We are still growing our repositories, but to start with, we have repositories dedicated for the following applications in the product portfolio:
* [PowerProtect Data Manager](https://github.com/SkunkworksAutomation/PowerProtectDataManager)
* [Avamar](https://github.com/SkunkworksAutomation/Avamar)

We have a metric ton of automation content coming soon but we want to ensure we post meaningful, relevant, and functional examples to address the most common use cases.
